🧠 Toy Language Interpreter (Java)
🚀 Project Summary
This Java-based interpreter is designed for a simple toy language, offering a hands-on way to understand key concepts in interpreters, Java programming, and GUI design. It provides an interactive environment where users can run pre-defined programs, inspect memory states, and follow execution flow through a graphical interface built with JavaFX.

🖥️ Key Features
Custom Language Execution
Executes a simplified toy language with support for basic control flow, expressions, and file operations.

Interactive Step-by-Step Debugging
A JavaFX-powered GUI allows users to step through each instruction, observing changes in program state in real time.

Live Memory Representation
Visualizes essential runtime structures like the stack and heap as the program progresses.

Basic File Handling
Includes functionality to work with files, though the language currently lacks a parser for external text files — all programs are defined directly in code.

Minimal Instruction Set
Supports core operations such as variable declarations, conditionals, and arithmetic/logical operations.

🧱 Language Components
The interpreter is structured around the following elements:

Expressions – Arithmetic, logical, and variable expressions

Statements – Control structures and execution logic

Types & Values – Basic type system implementation

TypeChecker – Static validation of program correctness

🎓 Educational Context
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment aimed at better understanding Java and interpreter design principles.
